# The-Perfect-Guess-Game
A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher number please”.

When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

whatever the gueses_count is made shud be stored in one text file
so if someone guessed the number in less count then the number stored in file ,then the count should be updated in file
By default count stored in file is 100
